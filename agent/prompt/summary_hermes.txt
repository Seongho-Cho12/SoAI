[Conversation]
{dialogue}

Guidelines:
- Summarize each important fact in one sentence.
- After each sentence, indicate its importance in parentheses using an integer between 1 and 10.
- High importance: character’s personality, emotions, values, relationships, behavior changes, strategic decisions.
- Low importance: trivial actions, generic small talk, repetitive or contextless phrases.
- Do not include explanations or reasoning—only output the final facts with scores.
- Write no more than 5 lines.
- Output should start immediately with the first bullet point, no intro.

Format example:
- Asuna saved Kirito's life during an adventure. (10)
- Asuna had toast today. (2)
