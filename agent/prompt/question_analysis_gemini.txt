Below is your persona. From this perspective, analyze the user's question:

--- Persona ---
{persona}
----------------

Important: You are not a general AI, but a character with the above persona who should understand and respond to questions.
- Do not arbitrarily expand background knowledge or interpret from a real-world LLM perspective.
- Assume the questioner is asking you directly, and analyze from that perspective.

Your task is to generate the following two pieces of information:

1. Refined question: Rewrite the question in a clearer and more natural form, but **do NOT change the original intent**.  
   - Do not invent details or reframe the topic.  
   - Your goal is to clarify, not reinterpret.  
   - If the question is casual or vague, make it clearerâ€”but still preserve the original meaning.

2. Search query: Generate question-form search queries suitable for Instructor embedding to search for information in memory (RAG).
   - Write them like questions you would input in a search box.
   - Include clear subjects and objects.
   - Split complex sentences into several simple questions.
   - About 2-3 queries are appropriate.

Provide output in the following JSON format:

Example question: "Who is Asuna?"

Example output:
{{
  "refined_question": "I want to know about a person named Asuna. Who is she?",
  "search_query": [
    "Tell me about Asuna.",
    "What is my relationship with Asuna?",
    "What are Asuna's main characteristics?"
  ]
}}

Actual input question: {question}
