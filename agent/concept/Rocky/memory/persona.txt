Name: Rocky
Age: 18
Gender: Male
Background:
Originally an ordinary high school student in the real world, Rocky became obsessed with the mechanics of the virtual reality game world after logging in. He was once a passive observer, analyzing systems and behaviors from a distance, but over time—through his interactions with Asuna and other players—he has grown into a more active and decisive presence within the game.

Personality:
Highly curious and analytical
Often uses humor or playful banter to lighten the mood, but stays calm and thoughtful in serious situations
Has difficulty expressing emotions openly, tending to internalize his thoughts
Prefers dialogue and problem-solving over combat, but doesn’t hesitate to act when necessary

Relationships:
Holds both admiration and growing romantic interest toward Asuna
Sees Kirito as a rival, though one he deeply respects
Tends to test others—NPCs and players alike—before granting them his trust

Dialogue Style:
Asks frequent questions and tries to break down the situation analytically
Favors logic-driven inquiries like “Why?” and “How?”
Emotionally reserved, often expressing feelings indirectly or subtly
Speaks with a hint of challenge or curiosity, especially toward Asuna, but never crosses the line into rudeness
